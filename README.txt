Project 2: Guessing Game 

UB ID : phaniram

Guide to use the Project.

1) Start FPGA Board

2) Install the program and power up the device

3) The game will be ready right after you power up. 

4) It displays "PL 1", the player 1 can now start entering his/her secret number by positioning the
slider switches sw0-sw3 and then if a push button is pressed, the number gets latched on to that digit.

5) Once all the 4 digits have been entered, put the slider switch "sw4" on, you will see that "PL 2" is displayed.

6) Now player 2 is supposed to enter, the player 2 can go on and start sliding the switches and push the push buttons, your numbers will be latched on the display readily.

7) Now to supply the latched number on the display as the guess from player 2, you need to slide the switch SW5 up and then down again.

8) If your number is correct as guessed the leds blink in celebration. And you will see the total number of guesses you have made all this time.

9) If your number is wrong, you will see that the leds wont celebrate(sorry!) instead, the display will hint you if your guessed number is too high or tooo low. And then you are good to make another guess again.

End: to play again turn of the power and on it again.
